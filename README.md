# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
I explored the dataset, which includes anonymized credit card
transactions, and perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and
exploratory data analysis. Using various machine learning algorithms like
logistic regression, decision trees and  Random Forest,I built
models to predict fraudulent transactions. I will also evaluate the performance of these models using
appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
